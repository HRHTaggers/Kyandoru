                <p>
                    Kyandoru was established in 2015. Every candle is hand poured by me in my studio in Kent in small batches, and all of the materials are purchased from suppliers in the UK. Each candle holder is also decorated by me in my studio. The designs are carefully printed and cut out by hand before applying to the holder. Each new candle and holder is tested several times before I am happy to make a batch and list them for sale. Burn testing is very important so that the candles and holders you receive are safe to use.
                    We currently sell non-scented candles and various holders for Tea Lights and Votives for all occasions.
                    If you have any questions or custom requests, please do get in touch with me and I'll be happy to discuss how I can help.
